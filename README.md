# InFitting: A Customer and Order Management App for Tailor Shops

## About the Project

At the beginning of my journey, I wanted to build an app for my dad, who used to take measurements and orders in a book. Sometimes, it took time to search for the customer he needed, so I decided to build this app. However, this app is not only for my dad but can also be used by any shop owner to manage and organize their customers.

I spent about 300+ hours on this project to build this app. This includes time spent on creating the UI, adding features, fixing bugs, and creating a beautiful and user-friendly app. I hope you find this app helpful and enjoy using it.

## Features

- **Customer details management**: Manage customer details easily and efficiently.
- **Measurement management**: Store and manage measurements for each customer.
- **Order management**: Manage orders and order details.
- **Send direct SMS to customers regarding their orders**: Notify customers about their orders easily.

## Built with

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based image and video management service.
